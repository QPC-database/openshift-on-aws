# OpenShift on AWS

![OpenShift on AWS](/images/WhyOpenShiftonAWS.gif)

## Speaking to customers who have adopted OpenShift on AWS, these are the drivers leading them to select OpenShift.

### Agility
All the above aggregate resulting in increased developer productivity, increased operational efficiency, and faster time to market.

### Hybrid use case ( Unified experience ):
Customers have a desire to have the same developer and operation process, experience and interfaces for both on premises as well as cloud. agility through familiarity. 

### Turn Key Solution
OpenShift provides the features of several AWS services in a turn key solution.

### Prescriptive security
OpenShift provides not only the tools and options for security but also a prescriptive guard rail approach on how to implement these.

### Abstractions
OpenShift provides abstractions on several layers to simplify and accelerate the role of developers and operators. 


## Customers have provided feedback that they are moving their OpenShift implementations to AWS for various reasons

### Availability :
Though OpenShift itself caters for resilience and application availability it still runs on top of other infrastructure layers.
Customers have moved to AWS as they can achieve greater availability on AWS than in their existing data centers.
Making use of AWS Regions customers can reach a more global target market without investing in data centers in those locations.

AWS availability zones become a part of this discussion.

Availability goes beyond AWS as a IAAS provider, customers are modernizing their applications and are attracted to consuming AWS native services which are build from the ground up to cater for resilience out of the box. i.e instead of a customer having bother with how to architect, implement and maintain a database in a high available manner, they could simply use AWS RDS.
It is these services which combine with the customer applications running in OpenShift which are highly attractive.

### Elasticity and Scalability:
Yes many customers are running an automated virtualization stack such as vmware or other on premises.
Yes they can scale to a degree.
Customers con only scale within the confines of their infrastructure investment before leading into costly (CAPEX ) and longwinded procurement cycles, on then result in administrative and operation overheads (OPEX)

The ability to provision, scale and manage all resources instantly via APIs is also desired by customers.

Again this is not limited to the IAAS features but also the native services. AWS provide services which scale automatically to meet the needs of the customer,  S3, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, etc.


### Security
At AWS security is priority 1!!!
All systems services and processes are build with security in mind.
Comprehensive list of compliance certifications,
Large collection of tools and services to allow customers to secure their business at various layers.
Rich list of customer who trust AWS for their sensitive and critical workloads.

### Rich feature and service set:
Instead of customers re inventing the wheel or investing time effort and resources into solving complex problems, they can take advantage of a rich set of AWS services and features which are rapidly expanding. 

### Cost:
Service cost reductions
Reserved instances
Spot instances
Savings plans
Consumption based pay as you use and only what you use model.
Rich cost tracking tools set
