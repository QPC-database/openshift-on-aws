## Accessing the cluster
There are multiple ways to interact with your cluster.  You can connect to it via the CLI or via the Web Console. We will review both options below.

### Accessing the cluster via the Web Console

Step 1:: Getting endpoint details:

----
rosa list clusters
rosa describe cluster -c <yourclustername>
----

In the output you will see the cluster API endpoint and the Web console URL.

Step 2:: Connecting to the web console.

----
Copy the url provided from the previous step into a web browser.
Click on your IDP.

Enter your GitHub user credentials (or other credentials if not using GitHub)
You should be logged in. If you've followed this guide in order, you will be a cluster-admin and should see a web console like the following with the "Administrator" panel visible.

A new tab will open, Click on “Display token”.
You will see a page like the following

----
Copy the `oc login` command and paste it into your terminal. Press enter
----


        $ oc login --token=sha256~GBAfS4JQ0t1UTKYHbWAK6OUWGUkdMGz000000000000 --server=https://api.my-rosa-cluster.abcd.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
        Logged into "https://api.my-rosa-cluster.abcd.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443" as "rosa-user" using the token provided.
        
        You have access to 79 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with ' projects'
        
        Using project "default".


We can now start using our cluster.
