### Upgrading the cluster

There are 3 ways to upgrade your cluster.

 * Manually via the CLI
 * Manually via the OCM UI
 * Automated upgrades

We will go through these three scenarios.

### Manually via the CLI

Step 1:: Check if there is an upgrade available by running the following command

----
rosa list upgrade -c <cluster-name>
----

You will get a list that shows the available version and the current version of your cluster.  For example:

    	$ rosa list upgrade -c <cluster-name>
    	VERSION  NOTES
    	4.6.15   recommended
    	4.6.13

    In our example we see that version 4.6.13 is available and so is 4.6.15.

Step 2:: Upgrade the cluster to the latest version by running

----
rosa upgrade cluster -c my-rosa-cluster --version 4.6.15
----

This will schedule the cluster for immediate upgrade.  It will take some time to complete.

### Manually via OCM UI

----
To perform or upgrade via the UI log into OCM (<https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift>) and select the cluster you want to upgrade.
Click on the “Update Settings” tab
Click on the “Update” button

### Set up automatic updates

----
To set up your cluster to be updated automatically log into OCM (<https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift>) and select the cluster you want to upgrade.
Click on the “Update Settings” tab.
Under “Update Strategy” click the “Automatic” radio button.
This will open up options for a day of the week and time that you can set for the update to occur.
Select a “Grace period” for allowing the nodes to gracefully drain before forcing the pod eviction under “Node draining”.
Click Save.
