== Build Triggers, Webhooks and Rollbacks - Oh My!
Once you have an app deployed in OpenShift you can take advantage of some continuous capabilities that help to enable DevOps and automate your management process.  We will cover some of those in this lab: Build triggers, webhooks, and rollbacks.


== A bit of configuration
We are going to do some integration and coding with an external git repository.  For this lab we are going to use github, if you don't already have an account, [you can create one here][1].

Step::1 Fork the repo

OK, let's fork the dc-metro-map app from a github account into your github account.  Goto [https://github.com/RedHatGov/openshift-workshops][2] and look to the top right for the Fork button.

> Click the Fork button

Github should redirect you to the newly created fork of the source code.



Step 2:: Build Trigger / Code Change Webhook

When using S2I there are a few different things that can be used to [trigger] a rebuild of your source code.  The first is a configuration change, the second is an image change, and the last (which we are covering here) is a webhook.  A webhook is basically your git source code repository telling OpenShift that the code we care about has changed.  Let's set that up for our project now to see it in action.

Jump back to your OpenShift web console and let's add the webapp to our project.  You should know how to do this from previous lab work, but this time point to *your* github URL for the source code.  

Step 3:: Create a project and add an application from Git.

----
Click the Add to Project button
Select the From Git icon
----

Make sure that you replace <b>YOUR_ACCOUNT</b> with your GitHub user ID. Click on the Show Advanced Git Options expander to fill in the Context Dir field:


----
Git Repo URL : https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/openshift-workshops.git
Context Dir : /dc-metro-map
Select Node.js
Application Name : dc-metro-map
Select Deployment Configuration
Click Create
----


The node.js builder template creates a number of resources for you, but what we care about right now is the build configuration because that contains the webhooks.  So to get the URL:

Step 4:: Create a web hook

----
oc get bc/dc-metro-map -o yaml | grep generic-webhook
----

which returns the name of the secret that we need to find:

----
name: dc-metro-map-generic-webhook-secret
----

Now that you have the name of the secret, you can get its value:


----
SECRET=`oc get secrets dc-metro-map-generic-webhook-secret -o yaml | grep -i key | sed 's/^.*: //' | base64 -d ; echo`
----

Last, we can get the URL for the webhook, this way:

----
oc describe bc/dc-metro-map | grep "Webhook Generic" -A 1 | sed "s/<secret>/${SECRET}/"
----

Which results in the information that we need:

----
Webhook Generic:
        URL:https://api.alexocp43.redhatgov.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/cicd-1/buildconfigs/dc-metro-map/webhooks/1234abcd5678efgh/generic
----


Copy the Webhook Generic URL to the clipboard, so that we can use it in GitHub.


In Administrator mode, 


----
Click Builds
Select Build configs
----

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-buildsList.png[project]

----
Click the dc-metro-map build config
----

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-buildconfigsummary.png[project]

----
Scroll to the bottom of the window.
Copy the Generic webhook to the clipboard, by clicking on Copy URL with Secret
----

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-deployconfigconfig.png[project]
Now you can see the links to get the various secrets.


Copy the Generic webhook to the clipboard, by clicking on Copy URL with Secret



Step 5:: Add webhook to the repo

> Now switch back over to github 


Let's put the webhook URL into the repository. At the main page for this repository (the fork), you should see a tab bar with code, pull requests, pulse, graphs, and settings.


image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-settings.png[project]

----
Click the Settings tab
----
Now you will see a vertical list of settings groups.

----
Click the Webhooks link
----

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-githubwebhooks.png[project]

----
Click the Add webhook button
Paste in the URL you copied
Disable SSL verification by clicking the button
Click the Add webhook button
----

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-githubwebhooks-add.png[project]


Good work! Now any push to the forked repository will send a webhook that triggers OpenShift to: re-build the code and image using s2i, and then perform a new pod deployment.  In fact Github should have sent a test trigger and OpenShift should have kicked off a new build already.


== Deployment Triggers


In addition to setting up triggers for rebuilding code, we can setup a different type of trigger to deploy pods.  Deployment triggers can be due to a configuration change (e.g. environment variables) or due to an image change.  This powerful feature will be covered in one of the advanced labs. See the Triggers link under More Information below.



== Rollbacks
Well, what if something isn't quite right with the latest version of our app?  Let's say some feature we thought was ready for the world really isn't - and we didn't figure that out until after we deployed it.  No problem, we can roll it back with the click of a button.  Let's check that out:

Step 6:: rollback the deployment

----
oc rollout undo dc/dc-metro-map
oc get pods -w
----

----
Click on Builds and then click on Builds
----



This is going to show basic details for all builds, for the dc-metro-map application.


image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-builds-builds.png[project]

----
Click the dc-metro-map build that you want to roll back to. For the purposes of this lab, click dc-metro-map-1.
Click on Actions, and then Rebuild, from the menu, in the upper right corner of the window.
----


image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-actions-rebuild.png[project]

You can go back to the Workloads, Deployments, dc-metro-map page, and click on the Events tab, to see your previous deployment spinning down and your new one spinning up.

image::ocp-lab-rollbacks-workloads-deployments-dcmm-events.png[project]


OpenShift has done a graceful removal of the old pod and created a new one.  

Note that the old pod wasn't killed until the new pod was successfully started and ready to be used.  This is so that OpenShift could continue to route traffic to the old pod until the new one was ready.


You can integrate your CI/CD tools to do rollbacks with the REST API. See the Rollbacks With the REST API link under More Information below.


== Summary
In this lab we saw how you can configure a source code repository to trigger builds with webhooks.  This webhook could come from Github, Jenkins, Travis-CI, or any tool capable of sending a URL POST.  Keep in mind that there are other types of build triggers you can setup.  For example: if a new version of the upstream RHEL image changes.  We also inspected our deployment history and did a rollback of our running deployment to one based on an older image with the click of a button.
