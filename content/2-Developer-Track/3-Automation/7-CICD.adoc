# CI/CD Defined
In modern software projects many teams utilize the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). By setting up a tool chain that continuously builds, tests, and stages software releases, a team can ensure that their product can be reliably released at any time. OpenShift can be an enabler in the creation and management of this tool chain.

In this lab we walk through creating a simple example of a CI/CD [pipeline] utilizing Jenkins, all running on top of OpenShift! The Jenkins job will trigger OpenShift to build and deploy a test version of the application, validate that the deployment works, and then tag the test version into production.

Step 1:: Create a new project


Create a new project named cicd-<YOURNAME>.
----
oc new-project cicd-<YOURNAME>
----




Step 2:: Instantiate a Jenkins server in your project

----
oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
oc logs -f dc/jenkins
----

----
--> Scaling jenkins-1 to 1
--> Success
----
Wait for logs to return "Success".  Note: This may take awhile.

Lets look at the same from the web console. You do not need to do this twice. This is just to show you the CLI and GUI Process

----
Login into the OpenShift web console
Switch to the developer interface
click add
From catalog
Filter on "Jenkins (Ephemeral).
Select the Project cicd-<YOURNAME> from Namespace
Click Create
Go to Topology, select the deployment configuration for jenkins, under details ... wait to pod scales to 1.

Step 3::Create a sample application configuration


----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/nodejs-sample-pipeline.yaml
----

Step 4::Confirm you can access Jenkins

Get the route to the Jenkins server. Your HOST/PORT values will differ
from the example below.


----
oc get route
----

----
NAME       HOST/PORT                            PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION     WILDCARD
frontend   frontend-cicd.192.168.42.27.xip.io             frontend   <all>     edge            None
jenkins    jenkins-cicd.192.168.42.27.xip.io              jenkins    <all>     edge/Redirect   None
----

Use Jenkins HOST/PORT to access through web browser


----
In Developer mode, under Topology, 
click the arrow, in the upper right corner of the jenkins icon
Select "Login with OpenShift" from Jenkins login page
----

The OpenShift login page is displayed in a new browser tab.

----
Login with your OpenShift user name and password
----

Step 5::Start the pipeline

----
Using the OpenShift Web Console, in Administrator mode, 
choose Builds
Select Build Configs
click on nodejs-sample-pipeline
From the Actions menu, choose Start Build
----

image::ocp-lab-cicd-start-pipeline.png[project]
image::ocp-lab-cicd-pipeline-actions-start_build.png[project]

When the pipeline starts, OpenShift uploads the pipeline to the Jenkins server for execution. 

The Jenkins dashboard should indicate that a new build is executing.

Back in the OpenShift Web Console, watch the pipeline execute. 

Step 6::Confirm application is available

----
In Developer mode, select the cicd-<YOURNAME> project, 
and click on Topology
Click on the arrow, at the upper right corner of the nodejs-mongodb6-example icon, to launch the web page
----

# Summary
In this lab you have very quickly and easily constructed a basic pipeline.
