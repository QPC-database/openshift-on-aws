The AWS Service Operator is an open source project allowing dev and ops teams to provision AWS services from within OpenShift using Kubernettes commands. The endpoints, and creds needed to consume these services are stored in the OpenShift secrets and can be bound to applications running in OpenShift.

The AWS Service Operator has now been taken over by the AWS container service team and will be going through a complete redesign and will become a tier 1 Open Source Project.

For dev and ops teams looking to manage AWS resources from within OpenShift itself this is certainly a project to keep track of.
