# Migrating and modernizing databases

{{% children showhidden="false" %}}


OpenShift and containers provide a means of portability which is attractive for customers in a hybrid context. This allows customers to move / run workloads in various locations spread across on premises and cloud.

Some workloads will see net new data sources being created while others see a migration of data from on premsises to the cloud.

In this module we will explore linking applications to databases using containers and OpenShift. We will explore net new databases and data, migration from on premises to the cloud using a lift and shift approach, and further modernization of workloads using native AWS services.

This module will reuse the the Source to image lab from module 2 deploying applications
