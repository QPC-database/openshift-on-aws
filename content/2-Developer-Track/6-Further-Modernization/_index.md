# Using integrations to further modernize applications

{{% children showhidden="false" %}}


Customers migrate OpenShift to AWS for various reasons. Ability to scale beyond their existing capability. Take advantage of global reach, using AWS regions to deploy workloads and data closer to customers around the world. Gain greater security, reduce costs and increase agility.

When we unpack modernization this is not as simple as investing in a tool set, it is not simply breaking down monolith applications and adopting containers. Though these are building blocks or strategies of modernization they are not the answer to every challenge.

In the following section we will explore how customers are using native AWS services to further modernize and compliment the application workloads runnning within OpenShift on AWS.

Taking an application, breaking it into isolated microservices, deploying these as containers and moving these into the cloud does not end the evolution.
Though this is a starting point for many customers, a means of getting into the cloud so that they are able to take next steps.

AWS service are designed and build to be scalabile, resilient, elastic, secure. Adopting AWS native services into an application design means teams do not need to invest time in solving the challenges of making their own solutions scale, or address all the concerns realted to making a solution resilient. 

## Common pattern of evolution

Use containers for portability to lift and shift workloads to the cloud.
Take advantage of tools, systems, interface and process teams are already familiar with to gain agility while learning new things.
Break down monolithic container applications into smaller microservices.
Adopt AWS native services to compliment container workloads or in some cases replace aspects of the application stack.

Commonly customers will adopt native database Services such as Amazon Relational database service RDS, nosql services such as DynamoDB, caching layers such as AWS Elasticache, messaging and queing, object storage. Customers select AWS as their primary cloud provider due to the comprehensive and growing service portfolio.
